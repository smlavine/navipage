.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

is a multi-file pager with features to streamline watching YouTube videos which
are linked in a file.

.I NOTE:
.B navipage
is in an early stage of development. It may have bugs, and the documentation

.SH USAGE
.B navipage
is a pager, which means its primary function is to view files.
.PP
On startup,
.B navipage
will read all of the
.I files
passed as arguments into buffers, unless a file is a directory, in which case
it will read all of the files in that directory. It will not go into
directories within that directory unless the
.B \-r
option is specified.
.PP
If
.B $NAVIPAGE_SH
is set, then that file will be ran as a shell script before anything else is
done.
.PP
If
.B $NAVIPAGE_DIR
is set, then all the files in that directory will be read, as if they were
passed as arguments and
.B \-r
was set.

.SH INSPIRATION
My original plan with
.B omnavi
was to receive an email every morning with my YouTube subscriptions. This works
reasonably well, however it is not perfect.  In particular, it is too
cumbersome to see videos that were uploaded on previous days (this requires
searching through past emails), and it is too cumbersome to save videos to
watch for later.
.B navipage
makes it easier to search for particular creators or videos, and quickly look
through multiple days worth of videos.
