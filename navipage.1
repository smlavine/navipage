.SH INSPIRATION
My original plan with
.B omnavi
was to receive an email every morning with my YouTube subscriptions. This works
reasonably well, however it is not perfect.  In particular, it is too
cumbersome to see videos that were uploaded on previous days (this requires
searching through past emails), and it is too cumbersome to save videos to
watch for later.
.B navipage
makes it easier to search for particular creators or videos, and quickly look
through multiple days worth of videos.
