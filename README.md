# INSPIRATION

My original plan with Omnavi was to receive an email every morning with my
YouTube subscriptions. This works reasonably well, however it is not perfect.
In particular, it is too cumbersome to see videos that were uploaded on
previous days (this requires searching through past emails), and it is
too cumbersome to save videos to watch for later.
