# [navipage](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/navipage)

A multi-file pager, initially designed for reading YouTube video lists
generated by [omnavi](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/omnavi).

See `man ./navipage.1` (or `man navipage` if navipage is already
installed) for extensive information on how to use navipage.

# Installation

To install:
```
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~smlavine/navipage
cd navipage
sudo make install
```

To uninstall:
```
sudo make uninstall
```

Feel free to modify `config.mk` to fit your local installation
needs.

navipage is intended to be built using GNU make. The only known
POSIX-noncompliant code is [this ifdef statement][ifdef] in
`config.mk`.

[ifdef]: https://git.sr.ht/~smlavine/navipage/tree/master/item/config.mk#L16

## Debugging

To compile with debug symbols, set `DEBUG` before running
`make`, like `DEBUG=1 make`. Source code symbols will be
present when debugging with tools like `gdb ./navipage` or
`valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=errors ./navipage`.
